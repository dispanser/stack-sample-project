* Stack Project Template and Cheat Sheet

This project aims to provide a stack project that works as a template for many
common use cases, including sample code for basic things. It's inspired by
[[https://pbrisbin.com/posts/haskell_project_checklist/][Pbrisbins haskell project checklist]].


** Project Goals

Create an annotated stack project with the following properties:
- [ ] multi-module build
- [ ] code generation: proto-lens
  - [ ] use the generated code in the same module
  - [ ] use the generated code in another module
- [ ] tests
- [ ] benchmarks
- [ ] nix support (not a nix-based build, just stack nix support)
- [ ] dependency outside of stackage

Use the following frameworks / libraries:
- [ ] tasty: test execution framework
- [ ] hedgehog: property based testing (integrate via tasty-hedgehog)
- [ ] criterion (or research)

Provide sample code:
- [ ] tests
- [ ] property-based tests
- [ ] benchmarks

acceptance criteria:
- [ ] documentation of the structure, describing each non-obvious entry

** stack.yaml
